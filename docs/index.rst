Terminal: for Simple and Beautiful
==================================

Terminal is designed for creating terminal-base tools, written in Python,
for developers who like simple and beautiful things.

Python's standard **logging** and **argparse** (or optparse) modules are
powerful, but the API is thoroughly ugly and hard to use. Terminal is
designed to make life simpler and better.
